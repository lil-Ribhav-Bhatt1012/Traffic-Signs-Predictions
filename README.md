# Traffic-Signs-Predictions using image processing with Convolutional Neural Network
So, I have made a project on this,Image classification is a task where the system takes an input image and classifies it with an appropriate label.

Today Image classification is used by any organization to make the process streamline, simple and fast. Have you ever wonder about my system is capable to identify my and my familyâ€™s faces, cars are capable to follow traffic rules automatically, This all happens when Image Processing came into account.

As technology advancement takes place there are new algorithms and neural networks become more powerful be capable to handle very large size images and videos, process them, and conclude them with proper subtitles.

A convolutional neural network is a class of deep learning which deals with processing image and video data by extracting features from them and build a neural network by assigning them weights and convolved them with a filter to classify and identify an image.

CNN is a prior choice of every data scientist to deal with any Image or video processing data. Using the transfer learning model and modifying it with our layers is also easy.
